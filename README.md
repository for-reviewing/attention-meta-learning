# attention-meta-learning
This repository contains an implementation of meta-learning for few-shot classification using attention mechanisms, specifically focusing on the CBAM integrated with ResNet18. The project utilizes the PlantVillage dataset and aims to demonstrate the benefits of attention-driven meta-learning for feature extraction and classification tasks.
